# OCR A-Level Computer Science Notes
These are my notes for the OCR June 2023 Computer Science A-Level.

I created these notes specifically for myself. They only contain what I didn't already know when revising for my exams. **Therefore, they do not contain everything.** 

Because of this, these notes should be used in conjunction with other notes to result in a complete coverage of the entire course. 

These notes were created using Word.
